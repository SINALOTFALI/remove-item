# remove-item
The provided code is a simple PyQt GUI application built using the PyQt5 library in Python. This application allows users to input or load text, apply a specific text processing logic, remove duplicates from the processed text, and then save the result to a new file.

Maybe one day I will add artificial intelligence to this program ðŸ˜‰
